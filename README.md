*Dig* was a Farcaster frame game that ran for a few months in 2024. 6,000 people played. You could click a button to have an NFT transferred to you. There was also a contract that stored ERC 20 tokens and at a random time every Monday payed the current holder 1k tokens from the available pool. There was a leaderboard of top 5 diggers throughout the week. If you were holding the NFT at the random time and win the payout, you'd receive double the tokens (2k).

Tokens in the ERC 20 contract must be whitelisted to avoid diggers getting spammy tokens. Current whitelisted tokens are degen, tn100x, mfercoin and higher.
